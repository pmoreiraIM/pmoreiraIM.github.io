# The workflow we want to analyse. By convention, the first stage should be
# the backlog / initial state, and the final stage should indicate the work
# is done.

# We map analytics names to JIRA status names. It's possible to collapse
# multiple JIRA statuses into a single workflow stage, as with `QA` below.
